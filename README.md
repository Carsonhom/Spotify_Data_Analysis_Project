## Introduction
A spotify data analysis excercise using data from the top spotify songs as of Fri Sep 27. In this project I used statistical analysis methods to derive insights from the raw data as to what attributes might contribute to a top charting song. This project covers many of the key areas of data analysis from data aggregation to exploratory data analysis. The source of the data used for this project can be found at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated).

Tools used:
